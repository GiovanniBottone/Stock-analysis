# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze stock information for our friend Steve, so he can present it to his first clients, his parents. In order to properly analyze the stock information, we had to refactor the Module 2 solution code to collect specific stock information for the years: 2017 & 2018. Once the information was collected, the goal was to analyze the data to determine if the stocks should be invested in or avoided.
