# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze stock information for our friend Steve, so he can present it to his first clients, his parents. In order to properly analyze the stock information, we had to refactor the Module 2 solution code to collect specific stock information for the years: 2017 & 2018. Once the information was collected, the goal was to analyze the data to determine if the stocks should be invested in or avoided. 

## Results
Below will show the exact code used for analysis:

There is a clear difference between the stock performance of 2017 and the stock performance of 2018, 10/12 stocks performed better in 2017 than in 2018.
